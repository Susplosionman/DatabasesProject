# DatabasesProject
Final project for CIS560 where we develop a Database that stores movies for a movie theatre. The application can be accessed by a theatre employee or someone looking to review or buy tickets to a movie. The employee can schedule showtimes and see sales, reviews, and users. The user can buy tickets or leave a review.
